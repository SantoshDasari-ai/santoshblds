The Cardio Lab's original 'Thrombogenicity Tester (TGT)' aimed to study clot formation by simulating pulsatile blood flow through an MHV. While innovative, it struggled to replicate key physiological factors such as flow patterns and valve closure dynamics, limiting its accuracy and potential for impactful insights. As part of my senior project, I am leading the development of the TGT 2.0, an upgraded model designed to address these challenges.",image:"/assets/projects/pulsatile-flow/optimized/Master Assembly Conference Render.JPG.jpg",technologies:["SolidWorks","Arduino","Python","Medical Devices"],demoUrl:"/projects/pulsatile-flow",status:"Senior Design Project - In Progress",institution:"San Jose State University",advisor:"Dr. Alessandro Bellofiore"},{id:"robotics-president",title:"SJSU Robotics President",description:"Led the development of a Mars rover prototype, managing cross-functional teams and implementing advanced control systems.",image:"/assets/projects/robotics/render.JPG",technologies:["Project Management","Robotics","Mechanical Design"],demoUrl:"/projects/robotics-president"},{id:"rag-ai",title:"RAG AI Tool",description:"Retrieval Augmented Generation AI Tool for generating responses based on specific knowledge bases.",image:"/assets/projects/ragapp/ragapp.png",technologies:["Python","AI","NLP"],demoUrl:"/projects/rag-ai"},{id:"surgical-drapes",title:"Surgical Robot Drapes",description:"Created a comprehensive manufacturing plan for the Da Vinci Xi surgical robot draping system.
